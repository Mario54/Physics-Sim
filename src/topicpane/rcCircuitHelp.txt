This is a simulation of the RC Circuit. 

To start the animation, you must enter your input in the 
textboxes. 

The default values are an example of good numbers to enter. 
If you enter random number, the simulation will probably act 
in a weird way, so enter your input by slightly changning the
default values.

After having decided what values to use for the simulation, 
press the button "Charge the capacitor". 

Once the button is pressed, the application will simulate the 
charging of a capacitor. While the simualtion is running, 
you can pause it at any time. 

Also you can press the button "Reset" to see the discharging 
instead of the charging of the capacitor.

Once the capacitor is charged at 95%, the simulation will 
automatically stop and you will be able to see the dischargning
of the capacitor which will also stop when the capacitor will 
be discharged at 95%.
