This is an animation of a particle affected by two plates' 
electromagnetic field while moving. This simulation takes 
into account the charges of the plates and the particle as 
well as the dot's velocity and the plates' electric field.

To start the animation, you must enter your input in the
text boxes.

The default values are an example of good numbers to 
enter. If you enter random numbers, the simulation could
act in a weird way, so enter you input by slightly 
changing the default values.

Take note that when the two plates are of the same sign, 
the particle won't move.

After having decided what values to use for the simulation,
 press the button "Start Animation".

Once the button is pressed, the application will simulate the
movement of a particle affected by the plate's electromagnetic field
and its initial velocity. While the animation is running, you can
pause at any time using the "Pause" button.

Once the object has fully stopped, you will be able to reset the 
animation by using the "Reset" button. Then, you will be able to
 simulate the object with other values.
