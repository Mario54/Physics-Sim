This is a simulation of an object affected by friction. 

To start the animation, you must enter your input in the 
textboxes. 

The default values are an example of good numbers to enter. 
If you enter random number, the simulation will probably act 
in a weird way, so enter your input by slightly changing the
default values.

After having decided what values to use for the simulation, 
press the button "Start animation". 

Once the button is pressed, the application will simulate the 
movement of an object affected by friction. While the 
simulation is running, you can pause it at any time. 

Also you can press the button "Reset" to restart.

Once the object has fully stopped, you will be able to reset
the animation and simulate the object with other values.
