This is an animation of an object affected by the Earth's 
gravitational force while being thrown in the air.

To start the animation, you must enter your input in the
text boxes.

The default values are an example of good numbers to 
enter. If you enter random numbers, the simulation could
act in a weird way, so enter you input by slightly 
changing the default values.

After having decided what values to use for the simulation,
 press the button "Start Animation".

Once the button is pressed, the application will simulate the
movement of an object affected by the Earth's gravitational force
and its initial velocity. While the animation is running, you can
pause at any time using the "Pause" button.

Once the object has fully stopped, you will be able to reset the 
animation by using the "Reset" button. Then, you will be able to
 simulate the object with other values.
